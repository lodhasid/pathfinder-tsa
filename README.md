### What is Pathfinder?

Pathfinder is a mobile navigation app designed to make indoor spaces truly accessible for people who are blind or have low vision. Worn comfortably on a lanyard at chest level, the user’s phone maintains an optimal field of view while allowing the experience to remain completely hands-free. This thoughtful, unobtrusive design ensures that users can move naturally and confidently through their environment without juggling devices or relying on touch-based interaction. Powered by advanced AI-driven computer vision, Pathfinder continuously analyzes the surrounding space in real time—identifying obstacles, doors, signage, and text—and translates that visual information into clear, intuitive audio guidance.
